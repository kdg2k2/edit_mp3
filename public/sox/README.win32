SoX
---

This file contains information specific to the Win32 version of SoX.
Please refer to the README file for general information.

The binary SOX.EXE can be installed anywhere you desire.  The
only restriction is that the included CYGWIN1.DLL must be
located in the same directory as SOX.EXE or somewhere within your
PATH.

SoX Helper Applications
-----------------------

SoX also includes support for SOXI.EXE, PLAY.EXE and REC.EXE and their
behaviors are documented in includes PDF's.  They have the same install
strictions as SOX.EXE.

PLAY.EXE and REC.EXE are not distributed with this package to reduce size 
requirements. They are, in fact, only copies of the original SOX.EXE binary which
changes SOX.EXE's behavior based on the executable's filename.

If you wish to make use of these utils then you can create them
yourself.

copy sox.exe play.exe
copy sox.exe rec.exe

If you are concerned with disk space, the play and record functionality can
be equated using the "-d" option with SOX.EXE.  The rough syntax is:

play: sox [input files and options] -d [effects]
rec: sox -d [output file and options] [effects]

wget
----

SoX can make use of the wget command line utility to load files over
the internet.  A binary copy of wget has been included with this
package of SoX for your convience.

For SoX to make use of wget, it must be located either in your
PATH or within the same directory that SoX is ran from.

Custom configuration of wget can be made by editing the file wget.ini
contained in the same directory as wget.exe.

Please consult wget's homepage for access to source code as well
as further instructions on configuring.
